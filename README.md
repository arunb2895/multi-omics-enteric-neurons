# Multi-omics Enteric Neurons

This repository is a starting point for exploring **multi‑omics data** from
enteric neurons — the neurons that form the enteric nervous system within the
gastrointestinal tract.  The goal is to integrate transcriptomic,
proteomic, metabolomic and other omic datasets to understand how enteric
neurons develop, adapt and communicate with their environment.

## Why enteric neurons?

Enteric neurons are sometimes called the *“second brain”* because they form
intricate networks that regulate gut motility, secretion and immune
responses.  With advances in single‑cell RNA‑seq and mass spectrometry we
can now study these neurons at unprecedented resolution.  Combining
datasets across different molecular layers — genes, proteins and
metabolites — offers a more complete picture of cellular state.

## Project structure

This repository includes a few basic components to get started:

- `data/` – a directory where you can place raw data files (e.g. FASTQ,
  proteomics CSVs, metabolomics tables).  This directory is empty by
  default.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and
  visualization.
- `src/` – source code for analyses, including scripts to download
  datasets, perform preprocessing and run statistical analyses.
  This folder now contains `multiomics_integrator.py`, a working
  prototype for integrating metabolomics, bulk RNA‑seq, spatial
  transcriptomics and single‑cell RNA‑seq datasets into a joint
  low‑dimensional space.
- `README.md` – this file, providing an overview and guidance.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (or create it on GitHub and clone it).  If you
   haven't created the repository yet, you can run:

   ```bash
   git init multi‑omics‑enteric‑neurons
   cd multi‑omics‑enteric‑neurons
   git remote add origin <your‑github‑repo‑url>
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies.  For Python analyses you might
   consider setting up a virtual environment and installing libraries
   such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit‑learn`, and `scanpy`.

3. Add your datasets to the `data/` directory and update the scripts in
  `src/` to point to them.  A simple integrator is provided in
  `src/multiomics_integrator.py`; it uses principal component analysis
  to reduce each omics layer separately, concatenates the results and
  performs a second PCA to learn a joint embedding.  This
  yields a working model that can serve as a starting point for more
  advanced multi‑omics integration.  Use the notebooks in
  `notebooks/` to explore your data, perform quality control and generate
  plots.

4. Commit your changes and push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: added project structure and README"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Next steps

This project is just a scaffold.  You can add more detailed documentation,
analysis pipelines and results as your research progresses.  Consider
including:

- Data processing scripts that integrate multiple omics layers.
- Statistical analyses comparing enteric neuron subtypes or conditions.
- Visualization code to create UMAP/tSNE plots, heatmaps, correlation
  networks and more.

Feel free to modify the structure to suit your needs.  Good luck with
your multi‑omics exploration of enteric neurons!
